	Whiteboard animation is a video style that shows the viewer static images being drawn on the screen. Typically the illustrations are accompanied by a narration that walks the audience through the story that is being told within the drawing. These animations are simple, yet undoubtedly engaging. 

There is no question that video marketing has exploded in the last decade, becoming a key aspect of any successful marketing plan. Everyone has jumped on the video bandwagon. This being said, it is no surprise that consumers are four times more interested in watching videos about a product rather than reading about one. The majority of marketers also list video marketing as the best form of ROI. This means that video marketing should not be at the bottom of your to-do list but instead a vital part of your businessâ€™ communication and marketing strategy.

Now that you know incorporating video into your business plan is a must, now the question becomes- what style of video should you invest in?

Using a whiteboard animation video can be an incredibly effective tool. They are an exciting and innovative way to advertise and market your services or products. These videos can be created to cater to a variety of specific industries without any of the fluff found in other styles of video. Additionally, a whiteboard video is intended to be focused. This means your message will be heard loud and clear.
