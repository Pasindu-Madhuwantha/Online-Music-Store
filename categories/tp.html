		typography—the technical name for "moving text"—is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. This text is presented over time in a manner intended to convey or evoke a particular idea or emotion.

In dynamic layout, text elements move in relation to one another. Letters and words may move away from one another on a 2D plane, or in three-dimensional space. Likewise, scrolling typography can scroll across the flat screen, or can appear to recede or advance. An iconic example is the Star Wars opening crawl inspired by the Flash Gordon serials.

Fluid typography
In fluid typography, letterforms change and evolve without necessarily changing location. An example is the subtitles of the international release of Night Watch: In a scene in which a character is being called by a vampire, he is in a pool and the camera is underwater. The caption appears as blood red text that dissolves as blood would in water.
